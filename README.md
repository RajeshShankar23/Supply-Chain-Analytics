# Supply-Chain-Analytics
# Business Problem
The problem we will be working on in this case study is a make versus buy decision. We are hired as a supply chain analyst at a  company called Ternate Industries - a company that sells replacement parts for industrial pizza ovens. our task is to calculate the full cost of the Make and Buy Options. We will be  using data tables of quotes and internal manufacturing estimates. A quote or a quotation is a document that a seller provides to a buyer to offer goods or services at a stated price, under specified conditions.

# Approach:

Problem Identification: The make versus buy decision at Ternate Industries focused on calculating the full cost of each option for replacement parts of industrial pizza ovens. This required analyzing quotes from external suppliers and internal manufacturing estimates to determine the most cost-effective solution.

Analytical Methodology:

Quotes Analysis: Utilized quotes dataset to analyze costs for the buy option. This involved understanding supplier quotes, unit costs, and non-recurring expenses associated with different production volumes.

Supplier Exploration: Explored how unit costs and non-recurring expenses varied with changes in volume for specific parts and suppliers.

Cost Metrics Calculation: Calculated extended cost and full cost to determine the total expenses involved in purchasing products from external suppliers, considering both unit costs and non-recurring expenses.

Visualizing Lowest Cost Supplier: Designed a report page to identify the supplier with the lowest full cost for a specific part number and quote volume combination, while also providing visibility to other supplier quotes.

Scenario Analysis: Developed a scenario analysis tool to assess the impact of different production volumes on full costs, using Power BI parameters to dynamically adjust volume inputs.

Make Option Assessment: Evaluated the full cost of internal production estimates, considering incremental costs such as equipment investments and additional unit capacity required.

Make vs Buy Comparison: Compared the full cost of the make and buy options to identify the most cost-effective solution for specific parts and production volumes.

# Insights:

Supplier Analysis: Expellio emerged as a significant contributor to non-recurring expenses, while Ringo Nova had the highest total sum of unit costs for specific parts. Widgetmakers, Inc. also played a notable role in both categories, indicating their importance in the supply chain.

Cost Trends: Overall, quoted costs tended to decrease with higher production volumes, reflecting economies of scale. However, certain suppliers and parts exhibited varying cost dynamics, highlighting the need for detailed analysis in supplier selection.

Scenario Planning: The scenario analysis tool provided valuable insights into the impact of changing production volumes on full costs, enabling better decision-making amid uncertainty.

Make vs Buy Decision: The comparison between make and buy options revealed cost advantages and trade-offs associated with each approach, helping to identify the most cost-effective solution for different parts and production volumes.

# Conclusion:

The comprehensive analysis enabled Ternate Industries to make informed decisions regarding the make versus buy dilemma for replacement parts. By considering factors such as supplier costs, production volumes, and incremental investments, the company can optimize its supply chain operations and maximize cost savings.

# Recommendations:

Supplier Optimization: Continuously evaluate supplier performance and negotiate favorable terms to minimize costs and enhance competitiveness.

Dynamic Scenario Analysis: Further develop the scenario analysis tool to incorporate additional variables and provide more robust insights into the impact of changing production volumes on costs.

Internal Production Efficiency: Explore opportunities to improve internal manufacturing processes and optimize capacity utilization to reduce incremental costs and enhance cost-effectiveness of the make option.

Continuous Monitoring: Regularly monitor market trends, supplier capabilities, and production requirements to adapt strategies and maintain cost competitiveness in the long term.
