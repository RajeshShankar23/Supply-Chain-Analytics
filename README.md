# Supply-Chain-Analytics
# Business Problem
The problem we will be working on in this case study is a make versus buy decision. We are hired as a supply chain analyst at a  company called Ternate Industries - a company that sells replacement parts for industrial pizza ovens. our task is to calculate the full cost of the Make and Buy Options. We will be  using data tables of quotes and internal manufacturing estimates. A quote or a quotation is a document that a seller provides to a buyer to offer goods or services at a stated price, under specified conditions.
